# SublimeCopyToSharePointRoot

You have installed the Copy To SharePoint Root plugin, great!

Note that in order for this plugin to understand where to put your file, it has to be under a mappable SharePoint directory. At the moment, it only supports files under "Layouts".

For more information check out the github repo at https://github.com/eakron/SublimeCopyToSharePointRoot
